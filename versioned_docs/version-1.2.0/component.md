### 1. Aqua cli
Aqua cli is a command line utility.
There are two command line utilities.
<ul>
<li>A rust implmentation [here](https://github.com/inblockio/aqua-verifier-rs)</li>
<li>A javascript implmentation  [here](https://github.com/inblockio/aqua-verifier-js) </li>
</ul>

ðŸ¤” You would ask why have two : <br/> `Js enable us to quickly proto type our ideas.While the rust implmentation is stable.`

ðŸš€ What does the aqua cli do ?  <br/>
The aqua cli enables your to generate, sign, witness  and verify aqua chains locally.

## Aqua container
