## Signature

A signature in AQP is a cryptographic signature generated by public-private key pair. The protocol should be abstract, where it will support ‘Method’ in later iterations. This will allow us to use different types of implementations such as: `PGP signatures`, `Ethereum`, or `Bitcoin wallet ’s` signatures.

In this specification, we use the AQP reference implementation’s signing method, which is via an Ethereum wallet.

```js
signature_hash = calculate_hash_sum(
    signature + public_key
)
```

The signature is generated by a wallet signing the following message:

```
I sign the following page verification_hash:" +[0x0x9dab72<revision_verification_hash>]
```


## Wallet
A wallet is a software for protecting and managing private cryptographic keys
(of private-public key pairs) which are used to govern digital assets. This is
done by authorization of transactions via digital signatures or by initiating
decryption processes to access data.

See [Separation of Concerns](design-principles.md#separation-of-account-and-service).

### Account

We are following Ethereum's account definition:
> In general, there are two types of accounts. Externally owned accounts,
> controlled by private keys. And contract accounts, controlled by their
> contract code
-- [Ethereum Whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/#ethereum-accounts)

In general, we can't prove if an account owner is a person or a machine. With
advancements in AI, it will become increasingly difficult to prove that a human
is a human. [Attempts are being made](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/) to
increase trustworthiness of accounts which fall short in questions of privacy
and security as they make public claims. Traditional know your customer (KYC)
combined with the AQP and Aqua Identity Protocol (AIP) identification processes
can provide similar "proof of being human" which can be attested to an account.
This allows us to outsource the problem of identification, where we only focus
on unique accounts which are sufficient for data accounting independent of
humans or machines. Identity claims issued via the AIP will help to provide the
context required to meaningfully interact between accounts.

For more on this topic, please read the [Aqua Identity
Protocol](aqua-identity-protocol.md).

### Domain
A domain is a unique namespace attributed to an account. It allows us to manage
services and files within that namespace creating a domain of data governance
After granted permissions, additional accounts can be added to share control
over a domain or singular assets. To enforce boundaries of a domain, additional
software like the [Guardian](guardian.md) is required.

E.g. by setting up the a data vault with your account it becomes your
domain of data governance.



### Transaction Security

Transaction security is an economic measure of the level of integrity assurance
for a transaction. It is defined as the cost required to forge a transaction.
The transaction security can be increased by cryptographic security and by strong
replication of transactions. Public distributed ledger systems are highly suitable
for providing very high level of transaction security at the cost of privacy
and immutability (data can't be changed or deleted). Today, public distributed
ledgers such as Bitcoin and Ethereum provide the highest level of transaction
security.

### Data Asset

Data turns into a valuable asset if it is accounted for. In an accounted form
it can be easily priced, exchanged or traded.

### Data Vault

Software used to store and manage data with an account. The software must apply
a secure architecture and measures for keeping data assets safe. This is
achieved through encryption, strong authentication and restrictive access to
keep data private by default.

Service](design-principles.md#separation-of-account-and-service)
