## Signature

A signature in AQP is a cryptographic signature generated by public-private key pair. The protocol should be abstract, where it will support ‘Method’ in later iterations. This will allow us to use different types of implementations such as: `PGP signatures`, `Ethereum`, or `Bitcoin wallet ’s` signatures.

In this specification, we use the AQP reference implementation’s signing method, which is via an Ethereum wallet.

```js
signature_hash = calculate_hash_sum(
    signature + public_key
)
```

The signature is generated by a wallet signing the following message:

```
I sign the following page verification_hash:" +[0x0x9dab72<revision_verification_hash>]
```
