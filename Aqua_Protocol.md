## Introduction

The Aqua Protocol (AQP) is a content-exchange protocol between hosts in
peer-to-peer environments, providing both trustworthiness and
accountability. This document describes the functions performed by the
protocol, a Proof-Of-Concept that implements it, and its interfaces. It
also showcases other services which can be developed on top of it.

## Motivation

There is no easy or automated approach for checking if data has been
manipulated or corrupted, is attributed to the wrong author, or is
attributed to the wrong time. It is impossible to verify the change
history of data and by which identity it was changed.

The Aqua Protocol (AQP) provides a foundation for creating trusted data,
which can be quickly and easily verified. This includes the verification
of integrity, the verification of account (who created or manipulated
the data), and the verification of existence and time.

The AQP provides a globally unique resource identification (URI) for
each chunk (revision) of verified data. A collision free address can
exist between multiple interacting hosts, each referring to multiple
URI's of verified data.

The AQP is used to realize the concept of [Data
Accounting](Data_Accounting "wikilink").

## Specification

All hashes are based on
[SHA3-512](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.202.pdf).
This encryption standard is used to construct
[Mobile-Content-Hash-Chain](Mobile-Content-Hash-Chain "wikilink")'s,
which are then fully or partially exchanged between hosts depending on
the application of the data.

To meter data we hash it in SHA3-512 which always has 128 characters.
This value can be used as a check sum to verify data integrity. The
check sum can then be entangled in a hash-chain to create an immutable
track record. We differentiate between REQUIRED and OPTIONAL data for
each revision.

### **Revision Verification Structure**

Addressing: A verified data structure is identified by its URI
**verification_hash** and grouped by its **genesis_hash** which are
linked to the first revision linked to each other.

The first revision created will create a verification_hash which has a
special meaning and is referred to as the genesis_hash. All future
revisions building upon that first revision will be attributed to the
genesis_hash as a unique URI for grouping. This allows us to understand
if two revisions are related without needing to verify the whole history
of the hash chain.

##### Verification_Hash
revision verification_hash **is the hash sum over the string formed by adding** 

|Input Order | Hash name      | Input     |

##### Signature

Is a cryptographic signature of a [Public-Private-Key
Cryptography](Public-Private-Key_Cryptography "wikilink") pair. The
protocol should be abstract, while it will support 'Method' in later
iterations. This will allow to use different types of implementations
like: PGP Signatures, Ethereum or Bitcoin [Wallet](Wallet "wikilink")'s.

In this specification we use the only currently implemented way of
signing which is with an Ethereum Wallet.

##### Witness

To complete the witnessing process, a Domain Manifest is created. This
is a collection of all witness revision hashes within one domain. A
[Merkle Tree](Merkle_Tree "wikilink") is used to unify all hashes of all
revisions and is then represented by a single hash value.

The witness_event_verification_hash is written to the [Witness
Network](Witness_Network "wikilink"). The
witness_event_verification_hash is then generated by using the
domain_manifest_genesis_hash and the merkle_root hash together. This
allows the page manifest itself to also be witnessed.

A single revision which is witnessed, will not store the whole [Merkle
Tree](Merkle_Tree "wikilink"), but only its relevant path to the
[Merkle Root](Merkle_Root "wikilink"). Performing a [Merkle
Proof](Merkle_Proof "wikilink") will mean that its revision is included
in the [Merkle Tree](Merkle_Tree "wikilink").

#### **GetHashChainInfoHandler.php data stracture**

-   genesis_hash
-   current_revision: returns the last written verification_hash
    representing the last revision grouped to this hash_chain.
-   domain_id
-   content: Returns e.g. header data for which interpreter to use to
    display or process the hash_chain. e.g. xml heador with side_info
    and namespace.

### **GetRevisionHandler.php data structure**

-   verification context
    -   transclusion: boolean (tells the verifier to scan content for
        sub-pages)
    -   signature: boolean (tells the verifier to load previous
        dependent revision)
    -   witness: boolean (tells the verifier to load previous dependent
        revision)

#### **GetRevisionHashesHandler.php** data structure

-   <revision_hash> or a list of <revision_hashes>

## Verification Process

Is a repetition of the verification data generation process, based on
the content data, and a comparison of their results.

**Verification of Content**

All hashes are recalculated in a separate client implementation, and
compared with the ones sent via the API. If the data was not altered or
corrupted; nor was a there a difference in the process to calculate the
hash, they will match. This will create a high level of assurance that
the integrity and history of the file in question was not altered.

**Verification of Account**

To verify that the account signature that signed the revision is valid.

**Verification of Time**

To verify that the witness event included in a revision is correct, a
lookup and comparison of the witness_event_verification_hash on-chain is
performed and compared with the recalculated event.

### Stateful Hyperlinks / Transclusions

## Appendix

The following content is informational and not part of the
specification. It should help to better understand utility, context and
services which can be built on top of AQP.

## Aqua Protocol v1.1 Changes

Moving over to revision based verification. This allows:

-   Bulk / in parallel verification; ensuring logarithmic verification
    times, not linear increasing verification times with longer history.
    In short: Much faster and scalable.
-   Single revision and range verification (you want to verify a
    specific part of the content-chain)
    -   This is useful for verification of identity claims, where
        trusted parties have signed the claim and for the validator it is
        sufficient to see that signature.
-   This allows direct verification after every edit via the Guardian.
    This is the preparation in the interaction to provide services
    through the [Guardian](Guardian "wikilink").
-   Changing the design to include transclusions e.g. this allows the
    verification of subpages via their stateful links /
    revision_verification_hashes
    -   This also allows the inclusion of media files in the
        verification process
    -   You can upload pictures, PDF's, Word-Documents and have them
        automatically included in the aqua protocol and therefore in the
        verified data-structure
-   Introduction of verification_context which indicates if the previous
    revision has signature or witness data, or if the current revision
    has transcluded resources. This will build the correct verification
    structure before verification.

Change in the data-structure:

-   when requesting a revision this is done via the
    GetRevisionHandler.php
-   the previous verification hash is always served as well
-   if signature or witness data is present in the previous revision,
    there is a flag (1/0) that this revision depends on the previous
    revision
-   transcluded resources will be added to the content hash for
    verification

### Data Accounting Protocol v1.2 \[TBD\]

-   Generalization of the Signature-Metadata to inform which signature
    method was used.
    -   GPG Signatures
    -   BTC Wallet Signatures
    -   Ethereum Wallet Signatures
    -   Done by: Displaying method used for signing, displaying
        underlying architecture.
-   Including Account as part of the verified data structure
-   Defining maximum payload size per revision

## Known Design Limitations

As the content (e.g. a file) is part of a revision, it makes sense to
investigate maximum payload per requested revision. If it exceeds the
supported maximum, the verification will fail.

-   Excluding large files from transfer and using an existing
    file-transfer protocol might be desired.

<!-- -->

-   As the file is wrapped in the verification_protocol, its transport
    can be a fully separated concern.

An alternative solution would be chunking the file into a maximum
allowed payload per request, and then the reassembling the file at the
destination. This would also allow for integrity verification as each
content load is integrity verified anyway. This would be the logical
segmentation of one logical revision into many smaller virtual
revisions, which will resolve after reassembly into the logical
verification_hash.

## Blockchain Context

DISCLAIMER: AQP is not a permissionless distributed ledger. It works
with single-node deployments and does not require the witnessing part
(which benefits from being published to a DLT) to be valuable and
working. AQP does not have a token nor is AQP distributed by default.

As some concepts are very similar as those used in DLT's, please refer
to the following:

A revision is similar to a block in a Blockchain structure, which has
its own ROOT HASH and a set of TRANSACTIONS which are included inside.
Our transactions is content written into a revision.
